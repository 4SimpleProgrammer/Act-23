        <p>Hey there little honey, won't you groove?
            <br><br>
            I've been trying all night to dance with you
            <br><br>
            Hey there little lonely, won't you stay?
            <br><br>
            I said, "I would rather die than feel this pain"
            <br><br>
            You said, "I know, I feel very much the same
            <br><br>
            But I'm afraid that I don't know, knowing is not my thing"
            <br><br>
            But I would like to dance with you
            Awkwardly in haze
            <br><br>
            To this little tune
            I said, "Hey there little honey, won't you groove?
            <br><br>
            I've been trying all night to dance with you"
            <br><br>
            I said, "Hey there little honey, won't you stay?"
            <br><br>
            I said, "I would rather die than feel this pain"
            <br><br>
            You said, "I know, I feel very much the same
            <br><br>
            But I'm afraid that I don't know, knowing is not my thing"
            <br><br>
            But I'm sure, I want to be with you
            <br><br>
            Awkwardly in haze
            <br><br>
            To our little tune
            <br><br>
            Well if you are sure
            <br><br>
            Well I know I'm sure
            <br><br>
            Well if you are sure
            <br><br>
            Well I know I'm sure
            <br><br>
            Well if you are sure
            <br><br>
            Well I know I'm sure
            <br><br>
            Well if you are sure
            <br><br>
            Well I know I'm sure
            <br><br>
            Well if you are sure
            <br><br>
            Well I know I'm sure
